# Multilable Classification Using VGG19 Covid X-Ray Images


This project aims to classify the input image as either a african Elephant  or a Asian Elepgant image. The image input which you give to the system will be analyzed and the predicted result will be given as output. Machine learning algorithm [Convolutional Neural Networks] is used to classify the image

# VGG19 Architecture 

VGG19 proposed by Simonyan and Zisserman (2014) is a convolutional neural network that comprises 19 layers with 16 convolution layers and 3 fully connected to classify the images into 1000 object categories. VGG19 is trained on the ImageNet database that contains a million images of 1000 categories.17-Sept-2021


VGG-19 is a convolutional neural network that is 19 layers deep. You can load a pretrained version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database [1]. The pretrained network can classify images into 1000 object categories, such as keyboard, mouse, pencil, and many animals.
